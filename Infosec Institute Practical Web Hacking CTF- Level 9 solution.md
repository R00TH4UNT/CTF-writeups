# Infosec Institute Practical Web Hacking CTF- Level 9 solution #

*Hello everyone!*

Iâ€™m **Ch4r0n** and this is my first Infosec Writeup blog. In this writeup I am going to solve a CTF related to website pentesting organised by the Infosec Institute team. So, letâ€™s get started.

Here's the [Problem URL](http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex9.php).

Okay so when you visit the URL you get this page, it says that we are logged in as **John Doe** but we need to be logged in as **Mary Jane** and also in the bottom left we see the problem is about **Broken authentication and Session Management**.
So we get an idea that we need to look for **cookies** and **tokens** because they are most commonly used for session management in websites.

Firstly, we need a tool for viewing and editing cookies. I would be using the [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en) extension in Chrome because its quite user-friendly.
Okay so after getting the extension added we open it up by clicking on the cookie shaped icon on the top right and we see these cookies in the webpage.

There are only two cookies- **user** and **PHPSESSID**. I chose to examine the **user** cookie for obvious reasons ðŸ˜‰.

Okay now under the value parameter we find the string: **Sk9ITitET0U%3D**, that has %3D at the end, which when url-decoded using an [online url-decoder](https://www.urldecoder.org/) gives us **=** at the end of the decoded string. This hints that it may be a **Base64** encoded string. I am going to try to decode that by opening up an online [Base64 decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/). We put the string under the Type parameter and press the decode button.

As you see, the decoded text is **John+Doe**, that is first name + surname of the user. So to get the solution we first need to base64 encode the string **MARY+JANE** and set it as the cookie. We visit an online [Base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/), enter the string and click on encode. We get the base64 encoded result: **TUFSWStKQU5F**.

Now we copy the string and fire up our EditThisCookie extension. Then under the value parameter of the **user** cookie we paste this string after removing the previous value and to save the changes we click on the red tick at the bottom of the extension pop-up. Now we reload the page aaaand **Boom**!

You see the info on Mary Jane and the congratulations message. You would be automatically redirected to level 10.

*Hope you enjoyed this write-up. Suggestions and criticism are welcome.*
